    $ cd chipshop/

    $ $EDITOR settings.py

    $ python manage.py syncdb

    $ python manage.py runserver


Please note that ``chishop/media/dists`` has to be writable by the
user the web-server is running as.

Using Setuptools
================

Add the following to your ``~/.pypirc`` file::

    [distutils]

        pypi
        local


    [pypi]
    username:user
    password:secret

    [local]

    username:user
    password:secret
    repository:http://localhost:8000

Uploading a package: Python >=2.6
--------------------------------------------

To push the package to the local pypi::

    $ python setup.py register sdist upload -r local


Uploading a package: Python <2.6
-------------------------------------------

If you don't have Python 2.6 please run the command below to install the backport of the extension::

     $ easy_install -U collective.dist

instead of using register and dist command, you can use "mregister" and "mupload", that are a backport of python 2.6 register and upload commands, that supports multiple servers.

To push the package to the local pypi::

    $ python setup.py mregister sdist mupload -r local
